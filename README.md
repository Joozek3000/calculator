Calculator app made with vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML

while making this app I've learned how important is to plan ahead before you start coding, in my case i had to rewrite everything from scratch 4 times!!! and it still is not perfect. I'm plannig to get back to this and make it more readeble, and add some things to the code in the near future
